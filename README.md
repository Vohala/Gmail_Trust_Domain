# Gmail-Trusted-Domain-Login
Gmail Trusted Domain Login is a Chrome extension that restricts Gmail logins to a user-defined domain. Unauthorized login attempts are blocked, and a custom alert is displayed. It works on Gmail login pages, ensuring that only emails from the trusted domain are allowed to log in.
